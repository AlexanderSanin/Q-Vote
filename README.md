# QVote

**QVote** is a quantum voting system utilizing quantum superposition and entanglement to ensure secure and private voting. This project simulates voting for four candidates using Qiskit, and it lays the groundwork for future enhancements like blockchain integration and a user-friendly web interface for voting.

## Features

- Quantum voting using Qiskit
- Simulation of votes from multiple voters
- Visualization of voting results
- Future improvements planned:
  - Blockchain integration for vote immutability
  - Webpage for a user-friendly voting experience

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/QVote.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd QVote
```
Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the quantum voting simulation, execute the following command:

```bash
