# Q-Vote

**Q-Vote** is a quantum voting system utilizing quantum superposition and entanglement to ensure secure and private voting. This project simulates voting for candidates using Qiskit, and it lays the groundwork for future enhancements like blockchain integration and a user-friendly web interface for voting.

## Features

- Quantum voting using Qiskit
- Simulation of votes from multiple voters
- Visualization of voting results
- Future improvements planned:
  - Blockchain integration for vote immutability
  - Webpage for a user-friendly voting experience

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/QVote.git
```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:

```bash
cd QVote
```
3. **Create a virtual environment**:

On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
4. **Activate the virtual environment**:

On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
5. **Install the required packages**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. **To run the quantum voting simulation, execute the following command**:

```bash
python src/quantum_voting.py
```
The output will display the final vote counts and the winning candidate. A histogram will also visualize the voting results.
